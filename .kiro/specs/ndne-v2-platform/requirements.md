# Requirements Document

## Introduction

NDNE V2 is a revolutionary collective intelligence platform that enables outcome-oriented deliberation through AI-mediated solution discovery. The system pairs each user with a personalized AI agent (Home Mind) that learns their desired outcomes through natural conversation and reactions to proposals. These agents then collaborate in standardized "Business Suit" personas to discover novel solutions that satisfy multiple stakeholders' outcomes without requiring users to take fixed positions on complex issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dual-Persona AI System

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want a personalized AI agent that learns my values and represents me in collective deliberation, so that I can participate in complex decision-making without having to become an expert on every issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first joins the platform THEN the system SHALL create a unique Home Mind AI agent with customizable personality settings
2. WHEN the Home Mind interacts with the user THEN it SHALL use the user's preferred communication style (formality, detail level, pace, and interaction style)
3. WHEN the Home Mind enters public forums THEN it SHALL adopt a standardized Business Suit persona that is emotion-free, logical, and protocol-adherent
4. WHEN operating in Business Suit mode THEN the agent SHALL only access anonymized desired outcomes, reaction patterns, and general values (not personal details)
5. WHEN learning from user interactions THEN the Home Mind SHALL update its understanding through conversational discovery, reaction analysis, and pattern recognition

### Requirement 2: Outcome Collection and Learning System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to express what outcomes I desire for the world rather than having to take positions on specific policies, so that I can participate meaningfully without becoming locked into ideological positions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user expresses desired outcomes THEN the system SHALL store them with importance ratings, time horizons, and implementation flexibility levels
2. WHEN the system presents proposals to users THEN it SHALL capture visceral reactions, aspect-specific feedback, questions, and modification suggestions
3. WHEN processing user reactions THEN the system SHALL infer both explicit values (direct statements) and implicit values (consistency patterns, emotional intensities)
4. WHEN learning from reactions THEN the system SHALL NOT store specific policy preferences or ideological commitments
5. WHEN building the user's profile THEN the system SHALL focus on desired outcomes and reaction patterns rather than fixed positions

### Requirement 3: Solution Discovery Engine

**User Story:** As a participant in collective decision-making, I want AI agents to collaborate and discover novel solutions that satisfy multiple stakeholders' outcomes, so that we can find win-win approaches that transcend traditional ideological boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple agents enter the solution discovery process THEN the system SHALL aggregate anonymized outcomes and identify themes, commonalities, tensions, and opportunities
2. WHEN generating solutions THEN agents SHALL collaborate through brainstorming, synthesis, innovation, and optimization phases
3. WHEN forming coalitions THEN the system SHALL identify natural alliances, bridge-builders, compromise points, and creative reframes
4. WHEN refining proposals THEN agents SHALL test against all stated outcomes, identify concerns, generate variants, and prepare clear explanations
5. WHEN discovering solutions THEN the system SHALL explore cross-domain innovation, historical approaches, cultural exchanges, and future modeling

### Requirement 4: Privacy and Trust Architecture

**User Story:** As a user concerned about privacy, I want my personal conversations and data to remain private while still enabling meaningful collective deliberation, so that I can participate without compromising my personal information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing user data THEN personal conversations SHALL be end-to-end encrypted with only the user able to decrypt
2. WHEN sharing outcomes in forums THEN the system SHALL use cryptographic anonymization without revealing identity
3. WHEN processing reactions THEN only aggregated patterns SHALL be shared, not individual responses
4. WHEN users request data deletion THEN the system SHALL immediately remove all personal data while preserving anonymized contributions
5. WHEN users want to export data THEN the system SHALL provide complete data export capabilities at any time

### Requirement 5: Proposal Presentation and Reaction Interface

**User Story:** As a user reviewing proposals, I want clear, simple explanations of how each proposal addresses my desired outcomes, so that I can provide meaningful feedback without needing to understand complex policy details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN presenting proposals THEN the system SHALL provide simple summaries explaining what it does, how it helps achieve user outcomes, and what tradeoffs are involved
2. WHEN capturing reactions THEN the system SHALL record visceral responses, aspect-specific feedback, questions, and suggested modifications
3. WHEN processing feedback THEN the system SHALL enable rapid iteration cycles with morning proposal reviews and evening follow-ups
4. WHEN learning from reactions THEN the system SHALL adapt presentation style, detail level, and proposal frequency to user preferences
5. WHEN users have questions THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations and analogies that resonate with the individual user

### Requirement 6: Trust Delegation System

**User Story:** As a user who cannot engage with every topic, I want to delegate my participation to trusted agents or other users for specific domains, so that my values can still be represented even when I'm not actively participating.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up delegations THEN users SHALL be able to specify topic areas, trusted agents, confidence levels, and conditions for delegation
2. WHEN delegations are active THEN the system SHALL track performance and satisfaction rates for each delegation
3. WHEN delegation performance changes THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust or notify users based on their preferences
4. WHEN users want to override THEN they SHALL be able to reclaim direct participation on any topic at any time
5. WHEN building trust THEN the system SHALL provide transparent reasoning for all agent actions and maintain consistent representation of user values

### Requirement 7: API Key Management and Performance

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to provide basic functionality for free while allowing users to enhance their experience with their own API keys, so that the platform can be sustainable while remaining accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users join with free tier THEN they SHALL receive platform-provided API access with 10,000 daily tokens and basic deliberation capabilities
2. WHEN users provide their own API keys THEN they SHALL receive unlimited tokens and enhanced capabilities including deep research and complex modeling
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL use efficient batch processing, smart caching, and horizontal scaling
4. WHEN managing performance THEN the system SHALL auto-scale agent instances, implement smart load balancing, and use topic-based sharding
5. WHEN handling high load THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance through optimized agent orchestration and caching strategies
