# NDNE V2 Prototype

An outcome-oriented collective intelligence platform that enables AI-mediated solution discovery without ideological gridlock.

## 🎯 Core Concept

Instead of forcing people to take fixed positions on complex issues, NDNE V2 focuses on what people actually want: better outcomes. Users express desired outcomes ("I want a world where...") and AI agents collaborate to discover novel solutions that satisfy multiple stakeholders.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Dual-Persona AI System**: Personal "Home Mind" that learns your values + standardized "Business Suit" for public forums
- **Outcome-Oriented**: Focus on desired outcomes rather than fixed positions
- **AI-Powered Discovery**: Intelligent matching and proposal generation
- **Privacy-First**: Your conversations stay private while outcomes are anonymized
- **Accessible**: Free tier with platform API + enhanced features with your own API key
