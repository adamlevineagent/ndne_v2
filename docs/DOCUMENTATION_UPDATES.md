- Updated technology stack details

## Current Platform Capabilities

The documentation now accurately reflects that the platform supports:
1. âœ… Complete user authentication and authorization
2. âœ… AI-powered conversation interface with Home Mind
3. âœ… Outcome collection and AI-powered extraction
4. âœ… Proposal generation with semantic similarity analysis
5. âœ… Full proposal viewing interface
6. âœ… Complete reaction capture system with statistics
7. ðŸ”„ Next: Outcome-proposal connections and AI learning system

## Documentation Quality Assurance

- All code examples verified against actual implementation
- API endpoints tested and documented with correct request/response formats
- Testing procedures validated with existing test scripts
- Environment variables checked against .env.example
- Project structure verified against actual file organization

## Next Documentation Tasks

When the next development phase begins:
1. Update outcome-proposal connection features
2. Document AI learning system implementation
3. Add user dashboard and navigation documentation
4. Update API key management features
5. Document production deployment procedures

The documentation is now comprehensive, accurate, and ready to guide both new developers and users through the current platform capabilities.
